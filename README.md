# Database description
The main idea of this project is to analyze amount of carbon dioxide being emitted into our communities or cities. Then look for patterns which can produce solutions that help decrease the amount of carbon dioxide in the air.
 	A list of responses is collected from cities describing their transportation options which includes usage of each specific transportation type and carbon dioxide levels. Each response contains a city name and total carbon dioxide emitted each year. Each city has specific communities/areas, and their carbon dioxide levels. Each city has percentages of their transportationâ€™s styles such as biking, driving, public transit, skateboarding, walking, Uber or any other form of transportation. Cities also tracked electric vehicle usage along with factory emission as well. Each community also has the total distance each transportation type accrues as well as the average distance each trip is for each transportation style. 
	For this project we can use different front-end software like a mobile app in Android of IOS or a web-based application. The backend can be in java-python or any language that can be used with micro-services/api structure. This backend with connect to the database and perform any MySQL operations for fetching any data. The backend will also oversee any data manipulation and then present it to the front-end application. 
	This project is different from other projects on the internet because the main idea is to go beyond just cities or states but into communities. With this we can truly understand specifically where the carbon dioxide emission is coming from and what patterns we see that can be used to nail down the problem.
